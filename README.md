# TASKER.

**Tasker is an intuitive task checklist application to help users manage their active and completed tasks.**

**Now with drag and drop functionality for your task cards! :D**

This project was created to experiment with TypeScript with React as well as to help myself create tasks which can be saved in local storage.
I was able to learn a lot about the benefits of TypeScript and will be definitely using it in the future!
